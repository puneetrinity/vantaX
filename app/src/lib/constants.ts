    question: 'What languages/tools are allowed?',

    question: 'Can non-CS students apply?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. If you can break down a problem and build a solution, your degree doesn\'t matter. VantaX evaluates execution, not credentials.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I participate in multiple challenges?',
    answer: 'Yes. There are 3 challenges across the week — 25, 27, and 29 April, each with a 2-day submission window. You can attempt all three. Each is independent and has its own leaderboard.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I lose internet mid-assessment?',
    answer: 'Your timer pauses are not supported — the 2-hour window runs continuously once started. Choose a stable connection. Submissions auto-lock at the deadline.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I get a certificate?',
    answer: 'All participants receive a VantaX participation credential. Top performers are introduced directly to partner companies for internship and entry-level interviews.',

    question: 'Can I retake a challenge?',
    answer: 'No. Each challenge has a single submission window. This isn\'t a practice test — it\'s a hiring audition.',

  {
    question: 'Is it free or paid?',
